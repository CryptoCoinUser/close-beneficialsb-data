            Thank you for your recent application for credit with Beneficial State Bank. Your request was
            carefully considered, and we regret to inform you that we are unable to approve your
            request at this time due to the following reason(s):
        </p>

            <#list adverseActionReasons>
                <ul>

            <p>Our credit was based in whole or part on information obtained in a report from the
                consumer reporting agency listed below. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, you
                have a right to know the information contained in your credit file at the consumer
                reporting agency. The reporting agency played no part in our decision and is unable
                to supply specific reasons why we have denied credit to you. You also have a right
                to a free copy of your report from the reporting agency, if you request it no later
                than 60 days after you receive this notice. In addition, if you find that any
                information contained in the report you receive is inaccurate or incomplete, you
                have the right to dispute the matter with the reporting agency:</p>

            <p>We also obtained your credit score from the consumer reporting agency and used it in
                making our credit decision. Your credit score is a number that reflects the

                the information in your consumer report changes.</p>
