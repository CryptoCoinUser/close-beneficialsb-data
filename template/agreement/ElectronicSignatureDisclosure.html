    <h2 class="center">Electronic Signature and Communication Disclosure</h2>

    <p>
      This Electronic Signature and Communication Disclosure ("Disclosure")
      applies to the accounts that you have requested and services provided by
      us. The words "we," "us," and "our" means Beneficial State Bank, its
      agents, affiliates, representatives, service providers, assignees and
      successors and the words "you" and "your" means you, the individual(s) who
      have applied for this account.
    </p>

    <p>
      As used in this Disclosure, "Communication" means each application,
      agreement, disclosure, notice, fee schedule, response to claims,
      statement, privacy policy, record, document and other information we
      provide to you, or that you sign or submit or agree to at our request,
      including, but not limited to, any authorization, agreement, disclosure,
      notice of our decision on your application, or other information related
      to the Service (e.g., account information, rates, fees, and other costs
      related to a financial product or service for which you are applying or we
      provide to you). “Service” means each and every account, product or
      service we offer or will offer.
    </p>

    <p>
      Certain laws and regulations require us to provide documents to you “in
      writing,” which traditionally means you are entitled to receive it on
      paper. The Electronic Signatures in Global and National Commerce Act (the
      “E-Sign Act”) allows us to provide these documents to you electronically
      with your consent. We also need your general consent to use electronic
      records and signatures in our relationship with you. Before we can provide
      you with the services or products you have requested, you must review and
      consent to the terms outlined below.
