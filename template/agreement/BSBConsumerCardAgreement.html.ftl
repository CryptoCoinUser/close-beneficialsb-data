    <h2 class="center">Consumer Cardholder Agreement</h2>

    <ol type="1">
      <li>
        <b>Agreement.</b> This Credit Card Agreement (this "Agreement") includes
        the Rate and Fee Table, which shows the rates, fees and pricing for your
        Account, and the terms which govern the use of your VISA credit card
        ("Card"), issued by Beneficial State Bank ("BSB") and corresponding
        account ("Account"), and outlines your responsibilities and ours. You do
        not have to sign this Agreement, but once you have accepted, signed or
        used the Card or the Account, the Agreement will be in force. Your Card
        and Account are governed by this Agreement, Statements, our Privacy
        Policy, any brochure describing benefits provided by VISA, all
        disclosures and materials provided to you before, and when you applied
        for and/or opened your Account and any future changes to the
        aforementioned documents. Please read all documents in their entirety
        and keep them for your records.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Annual Fees.</b> As a condition of participation in Beneficial State
        Bank's credit plan and the issuance of a card, you agree that there is
        no annual fee for VISA consumer accounts at this time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Use of Card.</b> Credit for purchases from a merchant or a cash
        advance from a participating financial institution may be obtained by
        you or an authorized user of your card presenting one of your cards to
        the merchant or participating financial institution and, if requested,
        by providing the proper identifying information and signing the
        appropriate drafts. Failure to sign a draft does not relieve you of your
        liability for purchases made or cash received. The use of this card for
        illegal transactions is prohibited. The card may also be used to obtain
        cash advances from certain automated equipment provided it is used with
        your correct Personal Identification Number (“PIN”) issued to you. We
        may place limitations on the frequency and the amount of withdrawal per
        day. Terminals or terminal operators may have other limits on the
        amounts or frequency of cash withdrawals. You will not be liable for the
        unauthorized use of the card or PIN issued to you which occurs before
        issuer receives notification orally or in writing of loss, theft or
        possible unauthorized use of a card or PIN. Lost or stolen cards or PINS
        should be reported immediately to Issuer by notifying CUSTOMER SERVICE,
        P.O. Box 31535, Tampa, FL 33631-3535, and Telephone (866) 839-3485.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Authorized Users:</b> You may request us to issue a Card to any other
        person(s) to allow such person(s) ("Authorized User") to access the
        funds in your Account. We reserve the right to refuse to issue any
        additional Card. We may also require additional information about each
        Authorized User and may limit their use of the Card. Each Authorized
        User will have certain information about your Account, you will be
        responsible for the Authorized User's use of Account, including anyone
        else the Authorized User permits to use the Account, even if not
        authorized or agreed to by you. For the avoidance of doubt, if you
        permit another person to have access to your Account, you are liable for
        all transactions made with the Card and all related fees incurred, by
        those persons. To cancel an additional Card, call the toll free
        telephone number on the back of Card to request cancellation; provided,
        however, you must follow-up no later than ten (10) business days with
        written notification to revoke (cancel) permission for any person you
        have previously authorized to use Card. Such notice should be delivered
        to address: Beneficial State Bank, Attention: Credit Card Operations,
        2002 NE MLK Jr. Blvd, Portland, OR 97212. If you wish to cancel or
        revoke the Authorized User' s access to the Card or Account, you must
        also immediately destroy all Cards in the possession of Authorized User.
        Until we have received your written notification of cancellation, you
        are responsible for all transactions and fees incurred by you or any
        Authorized User. Authorized Users may remove themselves from your
        Account by calling the number on the back of the Card. If you tell
        Issuer to revoke (cancel) an Authorized User's access to Card or an
        Authorized User revokes his/her access to your Card or Account, we may
        revoke (cancel) your Card and issue a new Card with a different Card
        number and/or Account number.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Balance Transfers.</b> Credit obtained by use of a Balance Transfer
        shall be treated as a credit purchase.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Merchant Holds on Available Funds:</b> When you use Card or Card
        number to initiate a transaction at certain merchant locations, such as
        hotels, restaurants, gas stations, and rental car companies, where the
        final purchase amount is unknown at the time of the authorization, a
        hold may be placed on the available funds in the Account for an amount
        equal to or in excess of the final transaction amount. The funds subject
        to the hold will not be available to you for any other purpose until the
        merchant sends us the final transaction amount. Once we receive the
        final transaction amount, it may take up to seven (7) days for the hold
        to be removed. During that period, you will not have access to the funds
        subject to the hold. You may experience difficulties using a Card at
        unattended vending machines, kiosks, and gas station pumps. If a Card is
        declined at a "pay at the pump" gas station even though you have
        sufficient funds available, you should pay for the purchase inside with
        the cashier.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Credit Line.</b> You will, from time to time, be informed of the
        amount of the approved credit line established for you, and you
        covenants not to make credit purchases or borrowings in excess of that
        amount. You are liable for all purchases and borrowings made with your
        cards by you or by anyone authorized to use your cards.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Promise to Pay:</b> You promise to pay all amounts due on Account.
        This includes amounts where you did not sign a purchase slip or other
        documents for the transaction. If there is an Authorized User, you are
        responsible for all charges made by that person, whether or not you have
        notified us that the person will be using Account and whether or not the
        amount of the actual use exceeds your permission.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Payment.</b> You must pay at least the minimum payment each month by
        the date shown on the Statement (the "Minimum Payment"). The Minimum
        Payment will be the larger of: <b>(1) $10.00</b> or
        <b>(2) 2% of the New Balance</b> shown on your statement (rounded upward
        to the nearest dollar) plus any amounts that are late or in excess of
        your credit line. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if your New
        Balance is less than $10.00, you must pay us the total New Balance. With
        regard to each payment, we will decide the order in which purchases,
        cash advances, finance charges, fees and costs are paid, subject to any
        restrictions under applicable law. We may allow you, from time to time,
        to skip one or more monthly payments, and we will notify you when this
        option is available. If you elect to skip a payment, finance charges
        will continue to accrue, and the requirement to make a Minimum Payment
        each month will resume following the skip payment period. If you pay
        less than the total balance outstanding and due, as shown on the
        Statement, it will be applied in the following order: (1) to any fees
        incurred or then due; (2) to finance charges and interest due; (3) to
        the portion of your balance that exceeds your credit limit; (4) to the
        outstanding balance on Card; (5) to any amounts subject to a government
        order. All payments applied to the balances will be first applied to the
        balance for the payments that are greater than the amount due under this
        Agreement, we will apply any excess amount to the outstanding fees and
        balance(s) due under this Agreement (with the highest APR due under this
        Agreement paid first) and any remaining amount of such excess will be
        reflected as a credit on your Account. If you mail your payment, please
        mail the payment to the address provided on your Statement using the
        envelope and payment coupon enclosed. Payment received by mail, to the
        address on the payment coupon, must be received by 5:00pm CT to be
        credited as of the date of receipt. Payments brought into a local BSB
        branch must be received by 5:00pm PT to be credited as of the date of
        receipt. If received after 5:00pm, in either time zone, it will be
        credited on the following business day.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Statements:</b> We will generally send or make available to you one
        Statement per Account at the end of each Billing Cycle. "Billing Cycle"
        means the days between the closing date shown on the last Statement we
        sent you and the closing date on your current Statement. However, under
        certain circumstances, the law may not require us to send or make
        available to you a Statement, or may prohibit us from doing so. We send
        only one Statement for all Cards with your Account number. If there is
        an Authorized User, we send the Statement to the primary applicant
        listed on the application.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Interest Charges.</b> You shall pay Interest Charges as shown on your
        monthly statements, for each billing period in which there is a cash
        advance or the Previous Balance is not paid in full prior to the Closing
        Date of the billing statement. For cash advance fees, please see the
        Rates and Fees Disclosure Table. We figure the Interest Charges on your
        account by applying the monthly Periodic Rate to the entire “ Balance
        Subject to Interest Rate.” The additional charge for cash advances shall
        not apply to any cash advance obtained under a separate credit agreement
        with you and written in connection with these regulations. The “ Balance
        Subject to Interest Rate” is the “ average daily balance,” of the
        account (including current transaction). To get the “ average daily
        balance,” we take the beginning balance of the account each day, add any
        new cash advances, credit purchases and other charges, and subtract any
        payments or credits, unpaid late charges, unpaid membership fees and
        unpaid Interest Charges. This gives us the daily balance. Then, we add
        up all of the daily balances for the billing cycle and divide the total
        by the number of days in the bill ing cycle. This gives us the “ AVERAGE
        DAILY BALANCE.” <b>Interest Charges</b> for credit purchases begin on
        the date the purchase is posted to the account unless the Previous
        Balance shown on the statement is paid in full prior to the Closing Date
        of the statement. Credit purchases made during the statement period and
        the Previous Balance will be excluded from the calculation of the
        “average daily balance” if the Previous Balance shown on the front of
        the statement was paid in full prior to the Closing Date of the
        statement. The Interest Charges for cash advances begin on the date the
        advance is posted to the account. You may avoid additional Interest
        Charges on an account by paying in full the New Balance shown on the
        account’s monthly statement within 25 days after the Closing Date for
        that statement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Variable Annual Percentage Rate.</b> The current monthly Periodic
        Rate and corresponding <b>ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE</b> for new accounts
        are disclosed within the accompanied card mailer. These rates may vary
        monthly and shall be adjusted on the first day of each billing period (“
        Change Date” ). The <b>ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE</b> on each Change Date
        shall equal the highest prime rate published in The Wall Street Journal
        “ Money Rates” tables on the last date of publication in the calendar
        month preceding each Change Date (“Index Rate”), PLUS a Margin. For more
        informationon current margin(s), please refer to the Rates and Fees
        Disclosure Table. The monthly Periodic Rate is 1/12th of the
        <b>ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE</b>. Beginning on the date an adjustment in
        the rate is effective and until the next Change Date, the monthly
        Periodic Rate then in effect will be applied to the balance in the
        account to determine the Interest Charges. An adjustment in the monthly
        Periodic Rate and corresponding <b>ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE</b> will apply
        both to the outstanding balances in the account and to new cash
        advances, (including any balance transfers from other credit card
        accounts), credit purchases, and other charges. An increase or decrease
        in the Index Rate will ca use an increase or decrease in the monthly
        Periodic Rate and corresponding <b>ANNUAL PERCENTAGE RATE</b> and may
        increase the amount and number of minimum payments. If the Index Rate
        ceases to be made available, Issuer may substitute a substantially
        similar index and margin.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>How We Will Calculate Your Variable APRs:</b> Variable APRs disclosed
        above are based on the [3.25%] Prime Rate as of March 24, 2020. Variable
        APRs may change when the Prime Rate changes. Any increase in the Prime
        Rate may increase your finance charges and your minimum payment. We
        calculate variable APR rate by adding a percentage to the Prime Rate
        published in The Wall Street Journal. Any change in the variable APR
        will take effect no earlier than the first day of the Billing Cycle
        following the Billing Cycle a change to the Prime Rate occurs. The Prime
        Rate is published in the Money Rates section of The Wall Street Journal.
        When a range of rates has been published on the day we calculate the
        variable APR, the highest of the rates will be used. If this Prime Rate
        is no longer available, we will select a new one.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Additional Fees.</b> Separate finance charges for purchases, balance
        transfers, and cash advances are determined by multiplying the daily
        periodic rate by the separate average daily balance for purchases,
        balance transfers, and cash advances, as set forth above. For a listing
        of fees charged in association with this card, please see the Rate and
        Fees Disclosure Table accompanying this Agreement. These charges will
        not be imposed if your request is in connection with or delivery of the
        documents in response to an alleged billing error under Regulation Z
        issued by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. Fees
        imposed will be posted to your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Can You Change My Account Terms?</b> We can change the terms of your
        Account as permitted by law. When required by law, we will send you
        notice before doing so.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Security Interest.</b> All credit advanced to you for credit
        purchases or cash advances constitutes loans made by us to you in the
        state of <b>California.</b> We disclaim as security, for loans made to
        you under these regulations, any security interest it may at any time
        have in household goods or real property. Except as disclaimed above,
        loans made to you after the effective da te of these regulations may be
        secured by collateral given by you to secure other loans from us.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Insurance.</b> We do not offer any group credit life, disability and
        loss of income insurance program at this time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Foreign Transactions.</b> If your card is used to perform a
        transaction in a foreign currency, the transaction amount will be
        converted to U.S. dollars by VISA International. VISA converts currency
        to U.S. dollars using either the government mandated exchange rate or
        the wholesale exchange rate, in effect one day before the date of the
        conversion, as applicable. The exchange rate is increased by 1% if the
        conversion is made in connection with a charge to an account and
        decreased by 1% if the conversion is made in connection with a credit to
        an account. The date of conversion by VISA may differ from the purchase
        date and the posting date identified in the monthly statement for the
        account. You agree to pay charges and accept credits for the converted
        transaction amounts in accordance with the terms of this paragraph.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Disputes.</b> You must inspect each Statement received and must
        immediately contact us about any errors or questions you have, as
        described in "Your Billing Rights" enclosed. If you do not notify us of
        an error, we will assume that all information on the Statement is
        correct. If we credit your Account for all or part of a disputed
        transaction, you give us all rights against others regarding that
        transaction, and will also: (1) give us any information about the
        disputed transaction, if we ask; (2) not pursue any claim or
        reimbursement of the transaction amount from the merchant or any other
        person; and (3) help us get reimbursement from others.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Default.</b> You covenant to observe and comply with these
        regulations and covenant not to permit an event of default to occur.
        Upon the occurrence of any one or more of the following events of
        default: (a) You fail to pay at least the Minimum Payment when due on
        two occasions within any 12-month period; or (b) You die, cease to
        exist, change residency to another state, become insolvent or the
        subject of bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or fail to observe any
        covenant or duty contained in these regulations, if such event or breach
        materially impairs your ability to pay amounts due; the full amount of
        your account for which the default occurred (including unpaid Interest
        Charges) shall, at our option become immediately due and payable if you
        do not cure the default within 15 calendar days after notice is mailed
        to the address we have on file for you, or given as otherwise provided
        by law. We have this right, without notice and opportunity to cure; if
        the default is your third default within 12 months and you are notified
        of the prior two defaults and you cured those defaults.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Termination.</b> Your consent to these regulations may be terminated
        at any time by surrendering the cards issued to you or at your written
        request, but such termination shall not affect your obligations as to
        any balances or charges outstanding at the time of termination.
        Termination by you shall be binding on each person in whose name the
        card is issued. If your spouse terminates this credit plan, the full
        amount of your account (including unpaid Interest Charges) may be
        declared immediately due and payable. You may terminate your privilege
        to use the cards if you move out of the service area of Beneficial State
        Bank, as defined by us from time to time. Unless sooner terminated, the
        privilege to use the cards shall expire on the date shown on the cards.
        At any time, without liability to you and without affecting your
        liability for credit previously extended, your privilege to use the
        cards may be revoked or limited to the extent not prohibited by law. The
        cards are and shall remain the property of us and you agree to surrender
        them to us upon demand.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Collection Costs:</b> To the extent permitted by applicable law, you
        agree to pay all costs and disbursements, including reasonable attorney
        fees, incurred by us in legal proceedings to collect or enforce your
        indebtedness and/or the terms of this Agreement.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Amendments.</b> We may amend these regulations from time to time by
        sending you advance written notice not less than 90 days prior to the
        effective date for any change that is either adverse to your outstanding
        balance or increases certain fees, as required by the
        <b>California</b> Consumer Act from time to time, or not less than 15
        days prior to the effective date for other changes, or as may otherwise
        be required or permitted by law. To the extent that we indicate in the
        notice and that the law permits, amendments will apply to your existing
        account balance as well as to future transactions. Notices are deemed
        given when mailed by us to your current address for mailing monthly
        statements. Invalidity of any provision of these regulations shall not
        affect the validity of any other provisions unless otherwise provided by
        the <b>California</b> Consumer Act.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Governing Law.</b> This Agreement is governed by applicable federal
        law and by <b>California</b> law. If any part of this Agreement is
        unenforceable, the remaining parts will remain in effect.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>State Notices.</b> All Accounts, including California and Utah
        Residents: As required by law, you are hereby notified that a negative
        credit report reflecting on your credit record may be submitted to the
        credit reporting agency if you fail to fulfill the terms of your credit
        obligations. California Residents: The applicant, if married, may apply
        for a separate account. After credit approval, each applicant shall have
        the right to use this account to the extent of any credit limit set by
        the creditor and each applicant may be liable for all amounts of the
        credit extended under this account to each joint applicant. Wisconsin
        Residents: Your signature confirms that this loan obligation is being
        incurred in the interest of your marriage or family. No provision of any
        marital property agreement, unilateral statement or court decree
        adversely affects a creditor's interest unless, prior to the time the
        credit is granted, the creditor is furnished a copy of the agreement,
        statement or decree or has actual knowledge of the adverse provision.
        New York, Rhode Island and Vermont Residents: We may obtain at any time
        your credit reports, for any legitimate purpose associated with the
        Account or the application or request for an Account, including by not
        limited to reviewing, modifying, renewing and collection on your
        Account. On your request, you will be informed if such a report was
        ordered. If so, you will be given the name and address of the consumer
        reporting agency furnishing the report. New York residents may contact
        the New York State Department of Financial Services to obtain a
        comparative listing of credit card rates, fees and grace periods. -
        (800) 342-3736 or https://www.dfs.ny.gov/. Ohio Residents: The Ohio laws
        against discrimination require that all creditors make credit equally
        available to all credit-worthy customers and that credit reporting
        agencies maintain separate credit histories on each individual upon
        request. The Ohio Civil Rights Commission administers compliance with
        the law.

      <li>
        <b>Waiver.</b> We will not lose any of our rights if we delay or choose
        not to take any action for any reason. We may waive our right without
        notifying you. Without limiting the generality of this section, we may
        waive finance charges or fees that we may charge you without notifying
        you and without losing our right to charge them in the future.
